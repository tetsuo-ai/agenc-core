## PR #159: fix(runtime): harden artifact update routing and verification
- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Files changed:** `runtime/src/llm/*`, `runtime/src/workflow/*`, `runtime/src/gateway/delegation-*`, `runtime/src/utils/delegation-execution-context.ts`
- **What worked:** Replacing heuristic artifact/workflow escalation with a direct-owner artifact contract fixed the route class, stale verification inheritance, conditional no-op semantics, and explicit `@artifact` normalization in one coherent runtime path.
- **What didn't:** Artifact-intent classifier precedence and workspace-grounding phrase detection were still too narrow at first, which let explicit `@PLAN.md` repair requests drift into grounded-plan-generation or artifact-only review until the classifier and grounding detector were tightened.
- **Rule added to CLAUDE.md:** no
