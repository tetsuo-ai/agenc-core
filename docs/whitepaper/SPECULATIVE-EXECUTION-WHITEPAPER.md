## Abstract

Decentralized autonomous agents represent a paradigm shift in distributed computing, enabling trustless coordination across organizational boundaries. However, current agent coordination protocols face a critical performance bottleneck: the sequential nature of cryptographic proof verification creates latency that scales linearly with workflow depth, rendering multi-step agent pipelines impractical for latency-sensitive applications.

This paper introduces *Speculative Execution with Optimistic Proof Deferral*, a novel execution model that enables downstream agents to begin computation before ancestor proofs achieve on-chain finality. Our approach maintains the security guarantees of proof-based verification while reducing end-to-end pipeline latency by 2.65-4.5× for proof-dominant workloads through strategic parallelization of execution and proof generation.

We present a formal model for speculative commitments in directed acyclic task graphs, prove correctness invariants for our proof ordering and rollback mechanisms, and describe an economic model using exponential stake bonding to align incentives and bound systemic risk. The architecture comprises five core components-DependencyGraph, CommitmentLedger, ProofDeferralManager, RollbackController, and SpeculativeTaskScheduler-implemented as extensions to the AgenC protocol on Solana.

Our analysis demonstrates that for an *n*-task pipeline with average execution time *T_exec*, proof generation time *T_proof*, and confirmation time *T_confirm*, speculative execution reduces total latency from O(*n* × (*T_exec* + *T_proof* + *T_confirm*)) to *n* × *T_exec* + *T_proof* + *T_confirm*, with all intermediate proof generation fully overlapping subsequent task execution. For typical proof-dominant workloads, this yields 2.65× speedup at pipeline depth 5, approaching (*T_exec* + *T_proof* + *T_confirm*) / *T_exec* asymptotically (4.5× for representative parameters). We present formal correctness arguments, failure mode analysis, economic attack resistance properties, and comparative analysis with alternative approaches including proof composition, incrementally verifiable computation, and hybrid optimistic/ZK models, establishing speculative execution as a practical and complementary approach for high-throughput decentralized agent coordination.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Rise of Autonomous AI Agents

The convergence of advances in large language models, verifiable computation, and blockchain technology has catalyzed the emergence of *autonomous AI agents*-software entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within digital environments with minimal human supervision. Unlike traditional automation, which operates within narrowly defined parameters, autonomous agents exhibit goal-directed behavior, adapting their strategies in response to environmental feedback and pursuing complex, multi-step objectives.

The economic implications are profound. Agents can negotiate contracts, execute trades, manage portfolios, and coordinate resource allocation across organizational boundaries without requiring trust relationships between their principals. This capability has spurred interest in *decentralized agent coordination protocols*-systems that enable agents owned by different parties to collaborate on shared tasks while maintaining verifiable accountability.

### 1.2 The Verification Bottleneck

Current approaches to decentralized agent coordination rely on cryptographic proofs to establish correctness. When Agent A completes a task, it generates a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) attesting that its computation satisfies predefined constraints. This proof is submitted to a blockchain, where on-chain verification confirms correctness before any dependent task can proceed.

While cryptographically sound, this model introduces significant latency:

1. **Proof Generation Latency**: Modern ZKP systems (e.g., Groth16, PLONK) require 2-10 seconds for proof generation, depending on circuit complexity.

2. **Network Latency**: Blockchain transaction submission and propagation add 400ms-2s per transaction.

3. **Finality Latency**: Achieving transaction finality requires waiting for block confirmation-approximately 400ms to 13 seconds on Solana, longer on other chains.

4. **Pipeline Multiplier**: For workflows with *n* sequential tasks, these latencies compound serially.

Consider a five-task agent pipeline where each task requires 5 seconds for proof generation and 2 seconds for on-chain confirmation:

```
Sequential Latency = 5 × (5s + 2s) = 35 seconds
```

This 35-second latency makes the system unsuitable for applications requiring real-time responsiveness, such as trading, emergency response coordination, or interactive assistants.

### 1.3 Contribution: Speculative Execution with Safety Guarantees

This paper presents a systematic approach to breaking the verification bottleneck through *speculative execution*. Our key insight is that while on-chain verification must ultimately occur in dependency order, *execution* need not wait for verification. An agent can speculatively execute a downstream task using an ancestor's uncommitted output, generating its proof in parallel. Once all ancestors achieve finality, the descendant's proof can be submitted.

The technical challenge lies in maintaining safety: if an ancestor's proof fails verification, all speculative work building on that foundation becomes invalid. Our system addresses this through:

1. **Speculative Commitments**: Local cryptographic commitments to task outputs that can be validated once ancestors confirm.

2. **Proof Deferral**: A queue mechanism ensuring proofs are submitted only after ancestors achieve finality, preserving the proof ordering invariant.

3. **Cascade Rollback**: Efficient mechanisms for reverting speculative state when ancestor proofs fail.

4. **Economic Bonding**: Stake requirements that scale exponentially with speculation depth, bounding systemic risk and aligning incentives.

We prove that our system maintains correctness invariants under all execution scenarios and demonstrate 2.65-4.5× latency reduction for typical proof-dominant multi-task pipelines.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Decentralized Agent Coordination

Decentralized agent coordination enables multiple autonomous agents, potentially controlled by different principals, to collaborate on complex tasks without centralized orchestration. The AgenC protocol [1] provides infrastructure for this coordination, implementing:

- **Task Definitions**: On-chain specifications of work units, including required capabilities, compensation, and deadline constraints.

- **Agent Registry**: A permissionless registry where agents stake collateral and advertise their capabilities.

- **Task Claims**: A mechanism for agents to commit to task execution by locking stake against performance guarantees.

- **Proof-Based Completion**: ZKP verification confirming that task execution satisfies specified constraints.

The protocol enables trust-minimized coordination: agents need not trust each other, only the mathematical guarantees provided by cryptographic proofs and economic incentives.

### 2.2 Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Task Verification

Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the statement's validity. In agent coordination, ZKPs serve multiple purposes:

1. **Correctness Verification**: Proving that computation satisfies task-specific constraints.

2. **Privacy Preservation**: Demonstrating correct behavior without revealing proprietary algorithms or sensitive inputs.

3. **Computational Integrity**: Enabling verification of expensive computations through succinct proofs.

The AgenC protocol employs RISC Zero's zkVM [14] with Groth16 [2] compression for on-chain verification. RISC Zero proofs are generated using a STARK-based prover and recursively compressed to constant-size Groth16 proofs (260 bytes: 4-byte selector + 256-byte proof) verified via the Verifier Router CPI on Solana [15]. On-chain verification requires approximately 200,000 compute units. However, proof generation remains computationally intensive, typically requiring 2-10 seconds for moderately complex circuits on GPU, with hardware acceleration and proof markets (Section 9.4) rapidly reducing these times.

### 2.3 The Latency Problem in Proof Pipelines

Sequential proof verification creates a fundamental tension between security and performance. Consider the following task pipeline:

```
Task A → Task B → Task C → Task D → Task E
```

In the standard execution model:

```
Time 0:    A executes
Time T:    A generates proof
Time 2T:   A submits proof, awaits confirmation
Time 3T:   B executes (using A's finalized output)
Time 4T:   B generates proof
...
Time 15T:  E confirms
```

Each task must wait for its predecessor's complete proof cycle before beginning execution. For *n* tasks with execution time *T_exec*, proof generation time *T_proof*, and confirmation time *T_confirm*:

```
Total Latency = n × (T_exec + T_proof + T_confirm)
```

This O(*n*) scaling in the latency-critical path creates an insurmountable barrier for deep task pipelines, limiting practical workflow depth regardless of available computational resources.

## 3. Problem Statement

### 3.1 Formal Definition of Task Dependency Graphs

We model task workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where vertices represent tasks and edges represent dependencies.

**Definition 3.1 (Task Dependency Graph).** A *task dependency graph* is a tuple *G* = (*V*, *E*, *σ*) where:
- *V* is a finite set of task vertices
- *E* ⊆ *V* × *V* is a set of directed edges representing dependencies
- *σ*: *V* → {PENDING, EXECUTING, PROVING, FINALIZING, FINALIZED, FAILED} assigns status to each vertex

An edge (*u*, *v*) ∈ *E* indicates that task *v* depends on the output of task *u*; we call *u* an *ancestor* of *v* and *v* a *descendant* of *u*.
The formal model supports arbitrary DAGs. The current implementation, by contrast, stores one parent pointer per task (`parentTaskId`), so practical dependency graphs are currently single-parent (tree/forest) structures.

**Definition 3.2 (Finalization Order).** A valid *finalization order* for *G* is a total order *π* on *V* such that for all (*u*, *v*) ∈ *E*: *π*(*u*) < *π*(*v*). That is, ancestors must finalize before descendants.

**Definition 3.3 (Speculation Depth).** For a task *v* ∈ *V*, the *speculation depth* depth(*v*) is defined as the length of the longest path from any finalized ancestor to *v*, counting only unfinalized nodes:

```
depth(v) = max { |P| : P is a path from some u to v where σ(u) = FINALIZED 
                       and ∀w ∈ P \ {u}: σ(w) ≠ FINALIZED }
```

If all ancestors of *v* are finalized, depth(*v*) = 0.

### 3.2 Sequential Execution Model

The standard execution model enforces a strict invariant:

**Invariant S1 (Sequential Execution).** A task *v* may only begin execution when all tasks *u* such that (*u*, *v*) ∈ *E* satisfy *σ*(*u*) = FINALIZED.

While this invariant ensures correctness-no task ever operates on invalid inputs-it serializes execution along dependency chains.

### 3.3 Latency Analysis

Let *n* denote the number of tasks in a linear pipeline. Define:
- *T_exec*: Average task execution time
- *T_proof*: Average proof generation time  
- *T_confirm*: Average on-chain confirmation time

Under sequential execution, total pipeline latency is:

```
L_sequential = n × (T_exec + T_proof + T_confirm)
```

For typical values (*T_exec* = 2s, *T_proof* = 5s, *T_confirm* = 2s) and *n* = 5:

```
L_sequential = 5 × (2 + 5 + 2) = 45 seconds
```

The critical observation is that proof generation and confirmation constitute the dominant terms, yet they cannot begin until execution completes. Our goal is to overlap these operations across pipeline stages.

## 4. Speculative Execution Model

### 4.1 Core Concepts

#### 4.1.1 Speculative Commitments

A *speculative commitment* is a cryptographic commitment to a task's output made before ancestor proofs achieve finality. Formally:

**Definition 4.1 (Speculative Commitment).** For a task *v* with output *O_v* and random salt *r*, the speculative commitment is:

```
C_v = SHA-256(H(O_v), r)
```

where *H* is a collision-resistant hash function and SHA-256 (via Solana's `hashv` syscall) is used for commitment hashing [3]. This choice leverages Solana's native SHA-256 support for efficient on-chain verification.

The commitment hides the output (through the salt) while binding the agent to a specific value. Upon proof submission, the agent reveals *O_v* and *r*, allowing verifiers to confirm *C_v* = SHA-256(*H*(*O_v*), *r*).

#### 4.1.2 Proof Deferral

*Proof deferral* is the mechanism by which generated proofs await ancestor finalization before on-chain submission. This preserves the critical invariant:

**Invariant P1 (Proof Ordering).** For any task *v* with proof submitted at time *t_s*, all ancestors *u* of *v* have finalization time *t_f*(*u*) < *t_s*.

Proof deferral allows execution and proof generation to proceed speculatively while ensuring that on-chain state transitions respect dependency ordering.

#### 4.1.3 Dependency-Aware Scheduling

The *speculative task scheduler* determines which tasks can begin speculative execution based on:

1. **Depth Bounds**: Maximum allowable speculation depth
2. **Stake Availability**: Required bond for the given depth
3. **Claim Expiry**: Sufficient time remaining before deadline
4. **Resource Limits**: Memory, compute, and parallel branch constraints

Tasks exceeding any bound are rejected for speculation and must wait for ancestor finality.

### 4.2 System Architecture

The speculative execution system comprises five core components:

```

#### 4.2.1 DependencyGraph

The DependencyGraph maintains the DAG of task dependencies, tracking:

- Parent/child relationships between tasks (single-parent structure in current implementation)
- Speculation depth for each node
- Confirmation/finality status (PENDING, SPECULATIVE, FINALIZED, FAILED)

Key operations include cycle detection (to prevent deadlock), topological sorting (for proof submission ordering), and depth computation (for scheduling decisions).

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface DependencyNode {
  taskId: Uint8Array;           // 32-byte task identifier
  parentTaskId: Uint8Array | null;
  children: Set<string>;        // Dependent task IDs
  status: DependencyStatus;
  depth: number;                // Speculation depth
  finalizedAt: number | null;
}
```

#### 4.2.2 CommitmentLedger

The CommitmentLedger serves as the local source of truth for speculative commitment state, managing:

- Commitment creation and lifecycle tracking
- Stake bonding and release
- TTL-based expiration
- State transitions (CREATED → PROOF_GENERATED → SUBMITTED → FINALIZED)

**State Machine:**
```
CREATED → PROOF_GENERATED → SUBMITTED → FINALIZED
    ↓           ↓              ↓
    └─────────→ EXPIRED ←──────┘
                   ↑
    ROLLED_BACK ←──┘
```

#### 4.2.3 ProofDeferralManager

The ProofDeferralManager implements the proof ordering invariant by:

1. Queueing generated proofs with their ancestor dependencies
2. Monitoring ancestor finality via blockchain events
3. Releasing proofs for submission when all ancestors are finalized
4. Coordinating with RollbackController on ancestor failures

**Critical Invariant Enforcement:**
```typescript
function checkSubmissionAllowed(taskId: Uint8Array): boolean {
  const ancestors = dependencyGraph.getUnfinalizedAncestors(taskId);
  return ancestors.length === 0;  // All ancestors must be finalized
}
```

#### 4.2.4 RollbackController

The RollbackController handles failure recovery through cascade rollback:

1. Detecting rollback triggers (proof failure, timeout, claim expiry)
2. Computing the affected descendant set via graph traversal
3. Executing rollback in reverse topological order (leaves first)
4. Releasing or slashing bonded stake based on failure cause

**Rollback Order Invariant:** Descendants are rolled back before their ancestors to ensure consistent state unwinding.

#### 4.2.5 SpeculativeTaskScheduler

The SpeculativeTaskScheduler coordinates speculative execution by:

1. Validating speculation eligibility against configured bounds
2. Computing required stake based on speculation depth
3. Coordinating task execution and proof generation
4. Enforcing resource limits (memory, concurrent operations)

**Scheduling Decision Flow:**
```
Validate Parent → Compute Depth → Check Depth Limit → 
Check Stake → Check Claim Expiry → Check Resource Limits → 
Accept/Reject
```

### 4.3 Execution Semantics

#### 4.3.1 When to Speculate

The scheduler approves speculation when all of the following conditions hold:

1. **Depth Constraint**: depth(*v*) < *max_depth*
2. **Stake Constraint**: *available_stake* ≥ *required_bond*(depth(*v*))
3. **Time Constraint**: *claim_expiry* - *now* > *claim_buffer*
4. **Resource Constraint**: *active_speculations* < *max_parallel*
5. **Parent Validity**: Parent exists and is not in FAILED state

The default configuration uses *max_depth* = 5, providing balance between latency reduction and rollback risk.

#### 4.3.2 Proof Ordering Invariant

**Theorem 4.1 (Proof Ordering).** In the speculative execution system, for any task *v* with proof submitted at time *t_s*, all ancestors *u* of *v* satisfy *t_f*(*u*) < *t_s*, where *t_f*(*u*) is the finalization time of *u*.

*Proof Sketch.* The ProofDeferralManager maintains a set *pendingAncestors* for each queued proof. A proof transitions to READY status only when this set becomes empty. Submission is gated on READY status. Ancestor finality events trigger removal from *pendingAncestors*. By construction, submission occurs only after all ancestors have finalized. □

See Appendix B for the complete formal proof.

#### 4.3.3 Rollback Cascade Semantics

When an ancestor task *u* fails (proof rejected, timeout, or claim expiry), all descendants must be rolled back:

**Algorithm 4.1: Cascade Rollback**
```
function rollbackCascade(failedTask):
    affected = computeAffectedSet(failedTask)  // BFS on children
    ordered = reverseTopologicalSort(affected)
    for task in ordered:
        cancelPendingProofs(task)
        markRolledBack(task.commitment)
        releaseOrSlashStake(task)
    validateNoOrphans(affected)
```

The reverse topological ordering ensures that descendants are rolled back before their ancestors, maintaining invariant consistency.

---

## 5. Safety and Correctness

### 5.1 The Fundamental Invariant

The speculative execution system is designed around a single fundamental invariant:

**Fundamental Invariant (FI).** At all times, for any task *v* with on-chain proof finalization, all ancestors *u* of *v* also have on-chain proof finalization, and *t_f*(*u*) < *t_f*(*v*).

This invariant ensures that on-chain state remains consistent with dependency ordering, even when off-chain speculative execution proceeds out of order.

### 5.2 Formal Correctness Arguments

We establish correctness through three key theorems:

**Theorem 5.1 (No Premature Submission).** Under the speculative execution protocol, no proof for task *v* is submitted to the blockchain while any ancestor of *v* remains unfinalized.

*Proof.* Let *v* be any task with proof *π_v*. The ProofDeferralManager gates submission on the condition:

```
pendingAncestors(v) = ∅
```

Initially, pendingAncestors(*v*) = {*u* : *u* is an ancestor of *v* and *σ*(*u*) ≠ FINALIZED}. Elements are removed only upon receiving on-chain finality events. Therefore, pendingAncestors(*v*) = ∅ implies all ancestors are finalized. □

**Theorem 5.2 (Rollback Completeness).** If task *u* fails, all descendants of *u* are eventually rolled back.

*Proof.* The rollbackCascade algorithm computes the affected set via breadth-first traversal from *u*, visiting all reachable nodes through child edges. By the definition of descendant (reachable via child edges), all descendants are included in the affected set. The algorithm iterates over all elements in the affected set, executing rollback for each. Post-rollback validation confirms no orphans exist. □

**Theorem 5.3 (Depth Bound Preservation).** For all tasks *v* in speculative execution, depth(*v*) ≤ *max_depth*.

*Proof.* The SpeculativeTaskScheduler rejects any task *v* where computed depth exceeds *max_depth*. Depth computation follows the definition (longest path of unfinalized ancestors). The depth check occurs before task acceptance and commitment creation. On-chain commitment creation also validates depth. By defense in depth, no task can enter speculative execution with excessive depth. □

### 5.3 Depth and Stake Bounding

Speculation depth is bounded to limit cascading failure impact. We employ a depth limit of *max_depth* = 5 by default, configurable per deployment.

**Stake Scaling:** Required stake increases exponentially with depth:

```
stake(d) = base_stake × 2^d
```

This exponential scaling ensures that deeper speculation requires proportionally greater economic commitment, naturally limiting the depth that rational agents will pursue.

**Table 1.** Stake requirements by speculation depth (base_stake = 0.001 SOL)

| Depth | Required Stake | Cumulative Risk |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0     | 0.001 SOL      | 0.001 SOL       |
| 1     | 0.002 SOL      | 0.003 SOL       |
| 2     | 0.004 SOL      | 0.007 SOL       |
| 3     | 0.008 SOL      | 0.015 SOL       |
| 4     | 0.016 SOL      | 0.031 SOL       |
| 5     | 0.032 SOL      | 0.063 SOL       |

### 5.4 Failure Mode Analysis

We conducted a comprehensive Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), identifying 43 potential failure modes across six components. The top five risks by Risk Priority Number (RPN = Severity × Probability × Detection Difficulty) are:

**Table 2.** Critical failure modes and mitigations

| Risk ID | Failure Mode | RPN | Primary Mitigation |
|---------|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| DG-002 | Stale dependency data | 240 | Version vectors with staleness TTL |
| DG-004 | Concurrent modification race | 224 | Reader-writer locks with COW |
| RC-003 | Missed task in rollback | 216 | Immutable snapshot traversal |
| CL-001 | Lost commitment record | 162 | Write-ahead logging |
| PDM-003 | Proof pipeline deadlock | 160 | Timeouts and circuit breakers |

Complete failure mode analysis with mitigations is provided in the supplementary materials.

## 6. Economic Model

### 6.1 Stake Bonding for Speculation

Economic security is provided through stake bonding. Agents must lock collateral proportional to their speculation depth:

**Definition 6.1 (Bond Requirement).** For task *v* at speculation depth *d*, the required bond is:

```
B(d) = B_base × 2^d
```

where *B_base* is the minimum stake (default: 0.001 SOL ≈ $0.20 at current prices).

This exponential scaling achieves several objectives:

1. **Self-Limiting Depth**: Rational agents naturally avoid excessive depth due to capital requirements.

2. **Risk Proportionality**: Deeper speculation, which affects more potential descendants, requires greater collateral.

3. **Capital Efficiency**: Shallow speculation (common case) requires minimal capital.

### 6.2 Slashing Conditions

Stake slashing occurs when an agent's speculative commitment is invalidated for preventable reasons:

**Table 3.** Slashing conditions and percentages

| Condition | Slash % | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Proof verification failure | 10% | Agent submitted invalid proof |
| Proof generation timeout | 5% | Agent failed to meet deadline |
| Ancestor failure (cascade) | 0% | Not agent's fault |
| Claim expiry | 5% | Agent failed to complete work |
| Manual cancellation | 0% | Voluntary exit |

Zero slashing for ancestor failures is critical: agents should not be penalized for factors outside their control. This encourages participation by limiting downside risk from speculation.

### 6.3 Incentive Alignment

The economic model aligns incentives through several mechanisms:

**Speculation Value Proposition:** Agents speculate because latency reduction creates value. Faster completion enables:
- Earlier reward collection
- Higher throughput (more tasks per time unit)
- Competitive advantage in time-sensitive markets

**Risk/Reward Balance:** Expected value of speculation at depth *d*:

```
E[V] = P(success) × V_completion - P(failure) × Slash(d)
```

where *P(success)* is the probability of successful confirmation. For typical scenarios where *P(success)* > 0.95 and *V_completion* >> *Slash*, speculation is positive expected value.

**Reputation Effects:** Persistent failure patterns (tracked off-chain) lead to reduced trust and potentially higher implicit costs through counterparty risk assessment.

### 6.4 Attack Resistance

#### 6.4.1 Griefing Attack

**Attack Vector:** Malicious agent deliberately fails proofs to trigger cascading rollbacks, wasting honest agents' compute.

**Defense (layered):**
1. Exponential stake bonding makes deep griefing expensive
2. Slashed stake distributed to affected downstream agents (proportional to wasted compute)
3. Reputation tracking identifies chronic griefers, reducing their speculation eligibility
4. Speculation whitelist based on historical reliability scores
5. Depth-dependent slash escalation (deeper speculation → higher slash percentage)

**Quantitative Analysis.** Consider an attacker at depth *d* = 0 (root task) triggering rollback of *k* descendants:

```
Attacker Slash     = B_base × slash_rate(d)
Victim Wasted Cost = k × T_exec × C_compute    (compute cost per second)
```

For *B_base* = 0.001 SOL, *slash_rate* = 10%, *k* = 4 descendants, *T_exec* = 2s, and *C_compute* ≈ 0.0001 SOL/s (approximate cloud GPU cost):

```
Attacker Loss  = 0.001 × 0.10 = 0.0001 SOL
Victim Compute = 4 × 2 × 0.0001 = 0.0008 SOL
```

In this scenario, the attacker's loss (0.0001 SOL) is insufficient to compensate victims' wasted compute (0.0008 SOL). This asymmetry is a known limitation of shallow-stake griefing.

**Mitigation: Depth-Dependent Slash Escalation.** We introduce escalating slash rates that account for downstream impact:

**Table 3a.** Enhanced slashing schedule

| Condition | Base Slash | Cascade Multiplier | Effective Slash |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Proof failure (depth 0, root) | 10% | 1 + 0.5*k* | 10% × (1 + 0.5*k*) |
| Proof failure (depth *d* > 0) | 10% | 1 + 0.25*k* | 10% × (1 + 0.25*k*) |
| Proof timeout | 5% | 1 | 5% |
| Ancestor failure (cascade) | 0% | 0 | 0% |

With cascade-aware slashing, the root attacker in the above example faces:

```
Enhanced Slash = 0.001 × 0.10 × (1 + 0.5 × 4) = 0.001 × 0.30 = 0.0003 SOL
```

Combined with the exponential bond requirement for deeper speculation (where griefing has greater impact), the economics become unfavorable. At depth 3 with 8 descendants:

```
Bond = 0.001 × 2^3 = 0.008 SOL
Enhanced Slash = 0.008 × 0.10 × (1 + 0.25 × 8) = 0.008 × 0.30 = 0.0024 SOL
```

**Remaining Limitation.** For very shallow, low-stake griefing (single root, few descendants), economic deterrence alone is insufficient. The reputation system serves as the primary defense: agents with >2% historical failure rate are excluded from speculating ancestors, effectively quarantining unreliable participants. This two-layer defense (economic + reputational) provides robust griefing resistance across all depth profiles.

#### 6.4.2 Front-Running

**Attack Vector:** Observer monitors speculative commitments and races to claim tasks first.

**Defense:**
1. Commitment-reveal scheme hides task details until proof submission
2. Private mempools (Jito) prevent transaction snooping
3. Short claim windows limit front-running opportunity

#### 6.4.3 Resource Exhaustion

## 7. Performance Analysis

### 7.1 Theoretical Latency Reduction

Consider a linear pipeline of *n* tasks. Let:
- *T_exec*: Execution time per task
- *T_proof*: Proof generation time per task
- *T_confirm*: On-chain confirmation time per task

#### 7.1.1 Sequential Model

Under sequential execution:

```
L_seq = n × (T_exec + T_proof + T_confirm)
```

Each task must complete its entire cycle before the next begins.

#### 7.1.2 Speculative Model

Under speculative execution, tasks execute sequentially (each uses its predecessor's output), but proof generation begins immediately after each task completes and runs in parallel with subsequent task execution. Proofs are submitted in dependency order once both (a) the proof is generated and (b) all ancestor proofs are finalized.

**Detailed Timeline.** Task *i* begins execution at time *t_i^exec* and finishes at *t_i^exec* + *T_exec*. Proof generation for task *i* begins immediately upon execution completion and finishes at *t_i^exec* + *T_exec* + *T_proof*. Proof submission for task *i* occurs at:

```
t_i^submit = max(t_i^proof_done, t_{i-1}^finalized) + q_i
t_i^finalized = t_i^submit + T_confirm
```

For a linear pipeline, task *i* begins executing at time (*i*-1) × *T_exec* (since each task must await its predecessor's output, but not its proof). Task *i*'s proof completes at time *i* × *T_exec* + *T_proof*. Task *i* can submit its proof once both (a) its proof is generated and (b) task *i*-1 is finalized on-chain, and then waits *q_i* for dispatch through the deferral queue. This yields the recurrence:

```
t_i^finalized = max(i × T_exec + T_proof, t_{i-1}^finalized) + T_confirm + q_i
```
with base condition *t_0^finalized* = 0 and *q_1* = 0.

where *q_i* ≥ 0 captures proof queue/dispatch delay (e.g., tx scheduling and queue contention). In the baseline model used throughout this paper, *q_i* = 0.

**Closed-Form Solution (q_i = 0).** When *T_exec* ≥ *T_confirm* (which holds whenever execution is not trivially fast compared to block finalization), proof availability is often the binding constraint. In this regime, each task's proof completes *after* the predecessor is finalized, and the recurrence resolves to:

```
t_i^finalized = i × T_exec + T_proof + T_confirm
```

The total pipeline latency is therefore:

```
L_spec = n × T_exec + T_proof + T_confirm
```

This captures the critical path: all *n* executions in series (each needing its predecessor's output), plus the irreducible cost of the final task's proof generation and on-chain confirmation. Every intermediate proof generation is fully hidden behind subsequent execution and confirmation steps.

**Simplification.** When *T_exec* ≈ *T_proof* ≈ *T_confirm* = *T*:

```
L_seq = n × 3T = 3nT
L_spec = nT + T + T = (n + 2)T
```

**Speedup Factor:**
```
S = L_seq / L_spec = 3n / (n + 2)
```

For *n* = 5: *S* = 15/7 ≈ 2.14×. As *n* → ∞, *S* → 3.0 in the equal-time case.

**Validity condition.** The closed form requires *T_exec* ≥ *T_confirm*. When *T_exec* < *T_confirm*, the confirmation chain becomes the bottleneck at some crossover point, and the latency increases to *L_spec* = *T_exec* + *T_proof* + *n* × *T_confirm* in the extreme case where *T_exec* ≪ *T_confirm*. In practice, Solana slot times (400ms) and typical task execution times (seconds) ensure *T_exec* ≥ *T_confirm* for virtually all workloads.

#### 7.1.3 Accounting for Proof Dominance

In practice, *T_proof* >> *T_exec*. For *T_proof* = 5s, *T_exec* = 2s, *T_confirm* = 2s, *n* = 5:

**Sequential:**
```
L_seq = 5 × (2 + 5 + 2) = 45s
```

**Speculative (traced timeline):**
```
t=0:  Task 1 executes
t=2:  Task 1 done, proof gen starts. Task 2 executes speculatively.
t=4:  Task 2 done, proof gen starts. Task 3 executes.
t=6:  Task 3 done, proof gen starts. Task 4 executes.
t=7:  Task 1 proof done (2+5). Submit immediately (no ancestors).
t=8:  Task 4 done, proof gen starts. Task 5 executes.
t=9:  Task 1 finalized (7+2). Task 2 proof done (4+5=9). Submit Task 2.
t=10: Task 5 done, proof gen starts.
t=11: Task 2 finalized (9+2). Task 3 proof done (6+5=11). Submit Task 3.
t=13: Task 3 finalized. Task 4 proof done (8+5=13). Submit Task 4.
t=15: Task 4 finalized. Task 5 proof done (10+5=15). Submit Task 5.
t=17: Task 5 finalized. DONE.
```

```
L_spec = 17s
Speedup = 45/17 = 2.65×
```

The timeline confirms the closed-form: *L_spec* = 5 × 2 + 5 + 2 = 17s. The steady-state cadence is *T_exec* = 2s per step (visible from t=9 onward), because each task's proof finishes exactly when the predecessor is finalized — proof generation (*T_proof* = 5s) is fully absorbed by the *T_exec* gap between consecutive tasks plus the *T_confirm* of the predecessor.

**Table 4a.** Pipeline latency analysis (*T_proof* = 5s, *T_exec* = 2s, *T_confirm* = 2s)

| Pipeline Depth | Sequential | Speculative | Speedup |
|---------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 3 | 27s | 13s | 2.08× |
| 5 | 45s | 17s | 2.65× |
| 10 | 90s | 27s | 3.33× |
| 20 | 180s | 47s | 3.83× |

As *n* → ∞ with proof-dominant parameters, the speedup approaches (*T_exec* + *T_proof* + *T_confirm*) / *T_exec* = 9/2 = 4.5× for these values. The asymptotic speedup equals the ratio of sequential per-task cost to speculative per-task marginal cost (just *T_exec*), since proof generation and confirmation are entirely hidden in the pipeline's steady state.

### 7.2 Overhead Analysis

Speculative execution introduces overhead in several dimensions:

#### 7.2.1 Rollback Costs

When an ancestor fails, descendants must roll back:

**Cost Components:**
- Compute: Wasted execution time for *k* descendants
- Memory: State snapshots for potential restoration
- Economic: Potential slash (mitigated by cascade exemption)

**Expected Rollback Cost:**
```
E[C_rollback] = P(failure) × (k × T_exec + k × Memory_snapshot)
```

For *P(failure)* = 0.02 (2% failure rate) and *k* = 3 average descendants:
```
E[C_rollback] = 0.02 × (3 × 2s + 3 × 10KB) ≈ 0.12s + 0.6KB per speculation
```

This modest overhead is typically recovered through latency savings.

#### 7.2.2 Memory Overhead

The system maintains additional state:
- DependencyGraph: O(*V* + *E*) for graph structure
- CommitmentLedger: O(*V*) for commitment records
- ProofDeferralManager: O(*V*) for queued proofs
- State snapshots: O(*V* × *snapshot_size*) for rollback recovery

For typical workloads with *V* = 1000 active tasks and 1KB per commitment:
```
Memory ≈ 1000 × (200B graph + 1KB commitment + 500B proof) ≈ 1.7MB
```

#### 7.2.3 Coordination Overhead

Component interaction adds latency:
- Event propagation: ~1ms per event
- Lock acquisition: ~0.1ms per operation
- Queue operations: ~0.01ms per operation

Total coordination overhead is typically <10ms per task, negligible compared to execution and proof generation times.

### 7.3 Expected Performance

**Table 4b.** Expected performance by scenario (*T_proof* = 5s, *T_exec* = 2s, *T_confirm* = 2s)

| Scenario | Sequential | Speculative | Speedup |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 3-task pipeline | 27s | 13s | 2.08× |
| 5-task pipeline | 45s | 17s | 2.65× |
| 10-task pipeline | 90s | 27s | 3.33× |
| Diamond DAG (4 tasks, 2 parallel branches) | 36s | 13s | 2.77× |
| Wide fan-out (1 parent, 4 children) | 18s | 9s | 2.00× |

Diamond DAGs with parallel branches achieve maximum benefit because independent branches execute and prove concurrently. The diamond DAG (A→{B,C}→D) completes B and C in parallel after A, with D starting once both finish — proof generation for B and C overlaps entirely.

**Best Case:** Deep pipelines with proof-dominant workloads approach 4.5× speedup asymptotically. Wide parallel DAGs can exceed this.

**Worst Case:** High rollback rates (>10%) can eliminate latency benefits. The system automatically falls back to sequential execution when speculation becomes counterproductive.

### 7.4 Impact of Evolving Proof Generation Latency

The performance analysis above uses *T_proof* = 5s, which reflected typical CPU-based proving in early 2025. The proof generation landscape is evolving rapidly:

**Table 4c.** Proof generation latency by platform (2025-2026)

| System | Hardware | Ethereum Block Proving | Simple Circuit (est.) | Source |
|--------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| SP1 Hypercube (Succinct) | 16× RTX 5090 (~$100K) | 10.3s avg | <1s | [22] |
| Pico Prism (Brevis) | 16× RTX 5090 (~$32K GPU) | 6.9s avg | <1s | [23] |
| R0VM 2.0 (RISC Zero) | GPU cluster (~$120K) | 44s | 2-5s | [25] |
| Airbender (ZKsync) | Single H100 | 35s | 1-3s | — |
| Fabric VPU (ASIC) | Custom chip | — | Sub-second (projected) | [28] |
| UniZK (academic) | Custom HW | — | 97× over CPU | [29] |

For AgenC's task completion proofs — which involve a 192-byte journal and relatively simple constraint logic — GPU-accelerated proving or proof market delegation can achieve *T_proof* ≈ 1s. Under these conditions:

```
T_proof = 1s, T_exec = 2s, T_confirm = 2s, n = 5:
L_seq  = 5 × (2 + 1 + 2) = 25s
L_spec = 5 × 2 + 1 + 2 = 13s
Speedup = 25/13 = 1.92×
```

Even with fast proofs, speculation still yields meaningful speedup because all proof generation and confirmation (except the final task's) is hidden behind subsequent execution. The speedup diminishes compared to the proof-dominant case (2.65× with *T_proof*=5s) because the sequential per-task cost is lower, but the pipelining benefit persists as long as *T_proof* + *T_confirm* > 0.

For complex proofs (ML inference verification, large dataset processing, multi-step constraint evaluation), *T_proof* remains significant even with hardware acceleration, preserving speculation's full value.

**Key insight:** Speculative execution provides speedup whenever the pipeline has depth. As hardware reduces *T_proof* for simple circuits, the asymptotic speedup shifts from (*T_exec* + *T_proof* + *T_confirm*) / *T_exec* toward a floor of (*T_exec* + *T_confirm*) / *T_exec* (i.e., 2.0× for our parameters). The technique's maximum benefit targets deep pipelines with proof-dominant workloads.

## 8. Implementation

### 8.1 On-Chain Components (Solana/Anchor)

The on-chain program extends the existing AgenC task infrastructure with speculation support:

#### 8.1.1 Task Account Extension

```rust
#[account]
pub struct Task {
    // Existing fields...
    pub creator: Pubkey,
    pub constraint_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub reward: u64,
    pub expires_at: i64,
    
    // New: Speculation support
    pub depends_on: Option<Pubkey>,  // Parent task PDA
}
```

The `depends_on` field establishes the on-chain dependency graph, enabling verifiable dependency ordering.

#### 8.1.2 Speculative Commitment Account

```rust
#[account]
pub struct SpeculativeCommitment {
    pub task: Pubkey,           // Task this commitment is for
    pub agent: Pubkey,          // Committing agent
    pub output_commitment: [u8; 32],
    pub speculation_depth: u8,
    pub bonded_stake: u64,
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub expires_at: i64,
    pub status: CommitmentStatus,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum CommitmentStatus {
    Active,
    Confirmed,
    RolledBack,
    Slashed,
}
```

#### 8.1.3 Instructions

**create_speculative_commitment:** Creates a new speculative commitment with stake bonding.

```rust
pub fn create_speculative_commitment(
    ctx: Context<CreateSpeculativeCommitment>,
    output_commitment: [u8; 32],
    speculation_depth: u8,
) -> Result<()>
```

**confirm_speculative_commitment:** Confirms a commitment after successful proof verification.

**slash_commitment:** Slashes stake for invalid commitments, distributing to protocol and affected parties.

### 8.2 Runtime Components (TypeScript)

The runtime implementation follows the architecture described in Section 4.2:

```typescript
// Main orchestrator
export class SpeculativeExecutionEngine {
  constructor(
    private dependencyGraph: DependencyGraph,
    private commitmentLedger: CommitmentLedger,
    private proofDeferralManager: ProofDeferralManager,
    private rollbackController: RollbackController,
    private scheduler: SpeculativeTaskScheduler,
  ) {
    this.wireEventHandlers();
  }

  async scheduleTask(request: ScheduleRequest): Promise<ScheduleResult> {
    return this.scheduler.schedule(request);
  }

  async onProofConfirmed(taskId: Uint8Array): Promise<void> {
    this.proofDeferralManager.onAncestorConfirmed(taskId);
    this.commitmentLedger.markConfirmed(taskId);
    this.dependencyGraph.markConfirmed(taskId);
  }

  async onProofFailed(taskId: Uint8Array, reason: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.rollbackController.triggerRollback(
      taskId, 
      RollbackReason.ProofFailed
    );
  }
}
```

### 8.3 Integration with AgenC Protocol

The speculative execution system integrates with the existing AgenC protocol through:

1. **Task Listener:** Monitors `TaskCreated` events for tasks with dependencies.

2. **Proof Submitter:** Wraps the standard `complete_task_private` instruction with deferral logic.

3. **Event Monitor:** Subscribes to on-chain events for confirmation tracking.

4. **Agent Manager:** Coordinates speculation with agent stake management.

```typescript
// Integration point
agentManager.on('taskClaimed', async (task, claim) => {
  if (task.dependsOn && speculationConfig.enabled) {
    const result = await speculativeEngine.scheduleTask({
      taskId: task.id,
      taskPda: task.pda,
      parentTaskId: task.dependsOn,
      claimExpiresAt: claim.expiresAt,
    });
    
    if (result.accepted) {
      // Proceed with speculative execution
      await executeSpeculatively(task, result.speculationDepth);
    } else {
      // Fall back to standard sequential execution
      await executeSequentially(task);
    }
  }
});
```

## 9. Related Work

### 9.1 Speculative Execution in Computer Architecture

The concept of speculative execution originates in computer architecture, where processors execute instructions before knowing whether the results will be needed.

**Tomasulo's Algorithm** [4] introduced out-of-order execution with register renaming, allowing instructions to execute speculatively while maintaining program correctness through a reorder buffer.

**Branch Prediction** enables processors to speculatively execute past conditional branches, achieving significant performance gains when predictions are accurate. Modern processors achieve >95% branch prediction accuracy.

**Meltdown and Spectre** [5,6] demonstrated that CPU-level speculation can create security vulnerabilities through side-channel attacks. Our system avoids these issues through cryptographic commitments (not caching side channels) and explicit stake-based accountability.

Key insight from architecture: speculation provides multiplicative speedup when the speculated path is usually correct, and rollback costs are bounded.

### 9.2 Optimistic Execution in Distributed Systems

**Optimistic Rollups** (Arbitrum [7], Optimism [8]) employ a similar philosophy: assume transactions are valid, allow challenges within a dispute window, and only verify on dispute.

Key differences from our approach:
- Rollups assume validity by default; we require eventual proof
- Rollups have multi-day challenge windows; we confirm within seconds
- Rollups rely on fraud proofs; we use validity proofs

**Optimistic Concurrency Control** [9] allows transactions to execute without locking, validating at commit time and aborting on conflicts. Our rollback mechanism shares conceptual similarity but operates at task granularity rather than database transactions.

**Pipelining in Distributed Databases** [10] overlaps query execution stages for throughput improvement. Our proof deferral is analogous to pipelining where proof generation is a distinct stage.

### 9.3 Agent Coordination Frameworks

**FIPA Specifications** [11] define abstract interaction protocols for multi-agent systems but lack cryptographic verification mechanisms.

**Ethereum's Account Abstraction** [12] enables smart contract-based agents but faces the same sequential verification bottleneck we address.

**Autonolas** [13] provides infrastructure for autonomous services but relies on reputation rather than cryptographic proofs for correctness guarantees.

Our contribution extends these foundations with the novel combination of ZKP-based verification and speculative execution optimized for latency-critical multi-agent workflows.

### 9.4 Alternative Approaches to the Verification Bottleneck

Several emerging technologies offer complementary or alternative approaches to the proof pipeline latency problem. We analyze each in the context of decentralized agent coordination and compare their trade-offs with speculative execution.

#### 9.4.1 Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) and Folding Schemes

Folding schemes, introduced by Nova [16] and extended by SuperNova, HyperNova [17], and MicroNova [18], enable *incrementally verifiable computation* where a prover produces a proof of correct multi-step execution with constant overhead per step. Rather than generating independent proofs for each task, the prover "folds" each step's proof into the previous one via a single multi-scalar multiplication, avoiding full recursive SNARK verification at each step.

**Advantages over speculative execution:**
- Eliminates the need for independent per-task proofs entirely
- No rollback risk, as the folded proof is valid at every step
- MicroNova achieves on-chain verification with O(log *N*) group elements [18]

**The multi-agent trust boundary problem.** IVC folding requires a *continuous prover* — each step's proof is folded into a running accumulator that the prover carries forward. In a multi-agent pipeline where Agent A executes Task 1 and Agent B executes Task 2:

1. **Accumulator handoff requires trust.** Agent B needs Agent A's internal accumulator state to fold Task 2's proof into the chain. This accumulator contains Agent A's prover-internal randomness and intermediate state. Agent A must either (a) hand over its prover secrets — a fundamental trust violation in a decentralized protocol — or (b) run all steps itself, which defeats the purpose of multi-agent coordination.

2. **No folding across trust boundaries.** The folding operation is not decomposable: one party cannot fold a step without the other party's accumulated state. There is no known construction for "trust-minimized" IVC where independent provers contribute to a shared accumulator without revealing their internal state. Split prover techniques [33] address witness partitioning but not accumulator sharing.

3. **Homogeneous proof system requirement.** All agents in a pipeline must use the identical folding-compatible constraint system (R1CS for Nova, CCS for HyperNova). AgenC's design allows agents to use any proving backend that produces a valid RISC Zero Groth16 proof — agents may run different hardware, different prover versions, or future alternative proof systems. Folding forecloses this flexibility.

4. **No production deployment on Solana.** No folding scheme has been deployed on Solana. Adapting RISC Zero's STARK-based pipeline to a folding scheme would require fundamental architectural changes to both the guest program and the on-chain verifier.

**Where IVC excels.** For a *single agent* running a multi-step pipeline internally — for example, an autonomous agent that claims and executes Tasks 1 through 5 sequentially — IVC is strictly superior to speculative execution. The agent holds the accumulator throughout, faces no trust boundary, and produces a single compact proof. However, this is not the primary use case for a decentralized coordination protocol; the interesting and difficult case is cross-agent pipelines.

**Assessment:** IVC is theoretically optimal for single-prover sequential computation but fundamentally inapplicable to multi-agent decentralized coordination, which is the core use case AgenC targets. The trust boundary between independent agents — the defining characteristic of decentralized coordination — is precisely where folding schemes break down and speculative execution with economic bonding provides a viable alternative.

#### 9.4.2 Proof Composition via RISC Zero

RISC Zero's zkVM provides native proof composition through the `env::verify()` guest API [14], allowing one guest program to verify another RISC Zero proof as an "assumption." The recursive proving pipeline resolves these assumptions, compressing a chain of composed proofs into a single Groth16 proof for on-chain verification.

**Relevance to AgenC:** A "batch verifier" guest could call `env::verify()` for each individual task completion proof, producing one aggregated proof that verifies *N* task completions in a single on-chain transaction. This reduces the per-task confirmation overhead from *N* × *T_confirm* to a single *T_confirm*.

**Advantages:**
- Uses AgenC's existing RISC Zero infrastructure — no proof system migration required
- Reduces on-chain costs by amortizing verification across multiple tasks
- Composable with speculative execution: agents speculate and generate proofs in parallel, then batch-compose proofs for submission

**Limitations:**
- Composition adds prover overhead (each `env::verify()` call increases the outer proof's circuit size)
- Requires all composed proofs to use the RISC Zero zkVM — cannot aggregate heterogeneous proof systems
- The batch verifier introduces a coordination point that may add latency for time-critical single-task completions

**Assessment:** Proof composition is a natural near-term enhancement to AgenC's existing architecture and is *complementary* to speculative execution. The optimal design combines both: speculative execution for latency reduction during pipeline execution, proof composition for cost reduction during on-chain settlement.

#### 9.4.3 Hybrid Optimistic/ZK Models

The OP Kailua system [19], deployed in production on BOB (the first Hybrid ZK Rollup), implements a model where transactions execute optimistically by default, with ZK proofs generated only when disputes arise or when users explicitly request fast finality.

**Brevis coChain** [20] extends this pattern to coprocessing: results are submitted as economic claims backed by restaked assets, with ZK fraud proofs serving as the dispute resolution mechanism. The overwhelming majority of operations never incur proof generation costs.

**Comparison with speculative execution:**

| Property | Speculative Execution | Hybrid Optimistic/ZK |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Proof generation | Always (deferred, parallel) | On demand (dispute/request) |
| Latency | Low (overlapped execution) | Lowest (no proofs in happy path) |
| Security model | Validity proofs for all tasks | Economic security + validity on dispute |
| Proving cost | Full (every task proved) | Minimal (most tasks unproved) |
| Finality | Cryptographic (seconds) | Economic (fast), cryptographic (on dispute) |

**Assessment:** Hybrid models achieve superior latency and cost by deferring proof generation entirely in the common case. However, they weaken the security model from universal validity to economic security with cryptographic fallback. For AgenC's use case — where task outputs may involve financial transactions, sensitive data processing, or high-stakes coordination — universal validity proofs provide stronger guarantees. A graduated approach is promising: use speculative execution for high-value tasks requiring cryptographic finality, and hybrid optimistic/ZK for lower-value tasks where economic security suffices.

#### 9.4.4 Proof Markets and Delegated Proving

Decentralized proof markets — Boundless [21] (RISC Zero), Succinct Prover Network [22] (SP1), Brevis ProverNet [23], and ZkCloud [24] — enable agents to outsource proof generation to specialized GPU operators who compete for proving work.

**Impact on the latency calculus:**
- Boundless processes 542+ trillion compute cycles with 98-100% order fulfillment
- SP1 Hypercube proves 99.7% of Ethereum blocks in under 12 seconds on 16 GPUs [22]
- Brevis Pico Prism achieves 6.9-second average Ethereum block proving [23]
- RISC Zero's R0VM 2.0 reduced Ethereum block proving from 35 minutes to 44 seconds [25]

For AgenC's relatively simple task completion proofs (192-byte journal, 260-byte seal), delegated proving to a market like Boundless could reduce *T_proof* from 2-10 seconds to sub-second, fundamentally changing the latency equation. When *T_proof* ≈ 0, speculative execution's benefit diminishes — the sequential model approaches *n* × (*T_exec* + *T_confirm*), which may be acceptable for many workloads.

**Assessment:** Proof markets are *complementary* to speculative execution, not alternatives. They reduce *T_proof*, which reduces the absolute latency but preserves the *relative* speedup ratio of speculative execution. The combination of speculative execution (for structural latency reduction) and proof markets (for absolute latency reduction) yields the best overall performance. However, Boundless does not yet support Solana settlement directly [21], limiting near-term applicability for AgenC.

#### 9.4.5 Proof Aggregation

Universal proof aggregation systems — NEBRA UPA [26] on Ethereum, Aligned Layer [27] on EigenLayer — batch multiple proofs from heterogeneous sources into a single on-chain verification, reducing per-proof gas costs by 75-90%.

**Relevance to AgenC:** If AgenC expands to EVM chains, proof aggregation could batch multiple task completions into a single verification, amortizing cost. On Solana, the lower base verification cost (~200K compute units for Groth16) makes aggregation less critical, but it becomes valuable at scale (hundreds of concurrent task completions per block).

#### 9.4.6 Hardware Acceleration

Custom hardware for ZK proving is advancing rapidly:
- **Fabric VPU** [28] — ASIC-class verifiable processing unit, partnered with both Polygon and RISC Zero, claims 900% more big-integer operations than GPU
- **UniZK** [29] — Unified hardware accelerator achieving 97× over CPU, 46× over GPU for end-to-end proof generation (ASPLOS 2025)
- **BatchZK** [30] — Fully pipelined GPU system achieving 259.5× throughput improvement with sub-second batch proving (ASPLOS 2025)

As hardware acceleration matures, *T_proof* could approach milliseconds for simple circuits, potentially eliminating the verification bottleneck entirely for many workloads. Speculative execution would remain valuable for complex proofs (ML inference verification, large dataset processing) where proving time remains significant even with acceleration.

#### 9.4.7 Comparative Summary

**Table 5.** Approach comparison for multi-task proof pipelines

| Approach | Latency Reduction | Proving Cost | Security Model | Multi-Agent | AgenC Fit |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Speculative Execution | 2.65-4.5× | Full (deferred) | Validity (universal) | Yes — core design | Native (implemented) |
| IVC/Folding | Optimal (single proof) | Minimal | Validity | **No** — requires single continuous prover | Single-agent pipelines only |
| Proof Composition | 1× (reduces confirm cost) | Full + overhead | Validity | Yes — aggregates independent proofs | High (RISC Zero native) |
| Hybrid Optimistic/ZK | Best (no proofs in happy path) | Minimal | Economic + validity fallback | Yes | Requires architecture change |
| Proof Markets | Reduces *T_proof* | Delegated | Validity | Yes | Pending (Boundless on Solana) |
| Hardware Accel. | Reduces *T_proof* | Capital-intensive | Validity | Yes | Transparent benefit |

**Our position:** The verification bottleneck in multi-agent coordination is fundamentally different from the single-prover case. IVC/folding — the theoretically optimal solution for sequential computation — cannot cross the trust boundary between independent agents, which is the defining characteristic of decentralized coordination. Speculative execution addresses precisely this gap: it preserves universal validity guarantees while enabling parallel execution across trust boundaries with economic bonding as the interim security mechanism.

Speculative execution is the right approach for AgenC because it (1) works across mutually distrusting agents without requiring shared prover state, (2) uses existing RISC Zero infrastructure on Solana, (3) preserves universal validity guarantees, and (4) composes well with proof composition (for batch settlement), proof markets (for reduced *T_proof*), and hardware acceleration as they mature.

### 9.5 Speculative Execution in Consensus Protocols

Recent work has applied speculative execution to blockchain consensus itself. *Proof-of-Execution* [31] (ACM TODS 2025) executes transactions before consensus is reached, achieving 86% throughput improvement over standard BFT protocols. *HotStuff-1* [32] introduces one-phase speculation where replicas speculatively execute and update local ledgers upon receiving a prepare-certificate.

These systems validate the core thesis of this paper — that speculative execution, with appropriate rollback mechanisms, provides significant performance benefits in blockchain settings — though they operate at the consensus layer rather than the application layer.

---

## 10. Future Work

### 10.1 Cross-Agent Speculation

The current system restricts speculation to single-parent dependency chains (implemented via `parentTaskId`), not necessarily single-agent pipelines. Cross-agent speculation-where Agent B speculates on Agent A's uncommitted output-introduces trust requirements:

- Agent B must trust Agent A's commitment (or post additional bond)
- Slashing distribution across agent boundaries requires careful design
- Reputation systems could modulate cross-agent speculation willingness

Research directions include:
- Cryptographic commitment schemes enabling cross-agent verification
- Game-theoretic models for optimal cross-agent speculation policies
- Trust network propagation for speculation eligibility

### 10.2 Adaptive Speculation Policies

Current speculation policies are static (fixed depth limits, stake ratios). Adaptive policies could:

- Adjust depth limits based on observed rollback rates
- Modify stake requirements based on task type risk profiles
- Learn agent-specific reliability for personalized bounds

Machine learning approaches for speculation decision optimization represent a promising direction.

### 10.3 Proof Composition for Batch Settlement

RISC Zero's native proof composition (Section 9.4.2) enables a near-term optimization: rather than submitting *n* individual `complete_task_private` transactions, a batch verifier guest program could compose *n* task proofs into a single Groth16 proof, reducing on-chain verification from *n* × ~200K CU to a single ~200K CU transaction. This requires:

- A new `complete_tasks_private_batch` on-chain instruction
- A batch verifier guest program that calls `env::verify()` for each inner proof
- SDK wrappers for batch proof submission

This is complementary to speculative execution: agents speculate and prove in parallel, then batch-compose completed proofs for amortized on-chain settlement.

### 10.4 Proof Market Integration

Integration with decentralized proof markets — particularly Boundless [21] once Solana settlement is available — would allow agents to delegate proof generation to specialized GPU operators. This could reduce *T_proof* from seconds to sub-second for AgenC's relatively simple task completion proofs, dramatically improving both sequential and speculative pipeline latency. Research questions include optimal delegation strategies, prover selection, and latency vs. cost trade-offs.

### 10.5 Competitive Task Speculation

The current analysis assumes cooperative pipelines where tasks have unique executors. In competitive task scenarios — where multiple agents race to complete the same task — speculative execution introduces additional waste: losing agents have generated proofs for outputs that will never be accepted. Future work should analyze the expected waste under competitive speculation and develop mechanisms (e.g., conditional speculation limited to one competitor per task, or pre-commitment auctions) to bound this cost.

### 10.6 Hardware Acceleration

Proof generation latency is rapidly decreasing through hardware acceleration:

- **GPU-based proving**: SP1 Hypercube achieves real-time Ethereum block proving on 16 GPUs [22]; RISC Zero R0VM 2.0 reduced Ethereum block proving from 35 minutes to 44 seconds [25]
- **Custom ASICs**: Fabric's Verifiable Processing Unit (VPU) [28] demonstrates 900% more big-integer operations than GPU, with direct RISC Zero partnership
- **FPGA acceleration**: Succinct targets 20× speedup via FPGAs in 2026
- **Academic advances**: UniZK [29] achieves 97× over CPU, 46× over GPU; BatchZK [30] achieves 259× throughput improvement

As *T_proof* approaches milliseconds, the verification bottleneck may be eliminated for simple circuits, reducing the value proposition of speculative execution for those workloads. However, complex proofs (ML inference verification, multi-step data processing) will continue to benefit from speculative parallelization.

### 10.7 Formal Verification

While we provide proof sketches for key invariants, full formal verification using tools like Coq or Isabelle would strengthen confidence in system correctness. Priority areas include:

- Proof ordering invariant (Theorem 5.1)
- Rollback completeness (Theorem 5.2)
- Economic security properties under adaptive adversaries
- Cascade-aware slashing fairness guarantees

## 11. Conclusion

This paper presented Speculative Execution with Optimistic Proof Deferral, a novel approach to reducing latency in proof-based decentralized agent coordination. By allowing downstream tasks to execute before ancestor proofs achieve finality — while maintaining strict proof ordering invariants — our system achieves 2.65-4.5× latency reduction for proof-dominant multi-task pipelines.

The key contributions include:

1. **Formal Model:** A rigorous definition of speculative commitments in task dependency graphs, with precise semantics for execution, proof deferral, and rollback. The tight latency bound (Section 7.1.2) corrects earlier simplified analyses and demonstrates stronger speedup than previously reported.

2. **Architecture:** A modular system design with five core components (DependencyGraph, CommitmentLedger, ProofDeferralManager, RollbackController, SpeculativeTaskScheduler) that can be integrated into existing agent protocols. The runtime implementation is complete and tested (~200+ dedicated tests).

3. **Safety Guarantees:** Formal proofs of critical invariants ensuring that on-chain state always reflects valid dependency ordering, despite out-of-order off-chain execution.

4. **Economic Model:** Exponential stake bonding with cascade-aware slashing that aligns incentives, bounds systemic risk, and provides layered attack resistance (economic + reputational) while maintaining capital efficiency for shallow speculation.

5. **Comparative Analysis:** Systematic evaluation against alternative approaches including IVC/folding schemes, proof composition, hybrid optimistic/ZK models, proof markets, and hardware acceleration (Section 9.4), establishing speculative execution as the appropriate technique for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination on Solana.

6. **Implementation:** Concrete specifications for Solana/Anchor on-chain programs and TypeScript runtime components, with the off-chain engine fully implemented and the on-chain integration path clearly defined.

The work establishes that speculative execution, long successful in hardware architectures and distributed databases, can be adapted for decentralized agent coordination while preserving the security guarantees that make such systems valuable.

As autonomous agents become increasingly prevalent in digital economies, the ability to coordinate complex multi-step workflows with minimal latency becomes essential. Speculative execution with optimistic proof deferral provides a principled approach to achieving this goal without sacrificing the trust guarantees that cryptographic verification provides.

## Appendix A: Formal Definitions

### A.1 Task Dependency Graph

**Definition A.1 (Task Dependency Graph).** A task dependency graph is a 6-tuple *G* = (*V*, *E*, *σ*, *τ*, *δ*, *β*) where:

- *V* is a finite set of task vertices
- *E* ⊆ *V* × *V* is a set of directed dependency edges
- *σ*: *V* → *Status* maps vertices to execution status
- *τ*: *V* → ℕ maps vertices to creation timestamps
- *δ*: *V* → ℕ₀ maps vertices to speculation depth
- *β*: *V* → ℕ₀ maps vertices to bonded stake (in lamports)

where *Status* = {PENDING, SPECULATIVE, FINALIZED, FAILED}.

### A.2 Speculative Commitment

**Definition A.2 (Speculative Commitment).** A speculative commitment is a 7-tuple *C* = (*v*, *h*, *r*, *d*, *b*, *t_create*, *t_expire*) where:

- *v* ∈ *V* is the committed task
- *h* ∈ {0,1}^256 is the output commitment hash
- *r* ∈ ℤ_p is the commitment salt
- *d* ∈ ℕ₀ is the speculation depth
- *b* ∈ ℕ₀ is the bonded stake
- *t_create* ∈ ℕ is the creation timestamp
- *t_expire* ∈ ℕ is the expiration timestamp

### A.3 System State

**Definition A.3 (System State).** The system state is a tuple *S* = (*G*, *L*, *Q*, *P*) where:

- *G* is the current task dependency graph
- *L* is the commitment ledger (mapping *V* → *C* ∪ {⊥})
- *Q* is the proof deferral queue (ordered list of (proof, ancestors))
- *P* is the active rollback plan (or ⊥)

### A.4 State Transitions

**Definition A.4 (Valid State Transition).** A state transition *S* → *S'* is valid iff:

1. No cycles are introduced in *G'*
2. All new commitments satisfy depth bounds

## Appendix B: Proof Sketches

### B.1 Proof of Theorem 5.1 (No Premature Submission)

**Theorem 5.1.** Under the speculative execution protocol, no proof for task *v* is submitted to the blockchain while any ancestor of *v* remains unfinalized.

**Proof.** We prove by examining the proof submission pathway.

*Claim 1:* A proof for task *v* enters the submission path only through `ProofDeferralManager.processReadyQueue()`.

*Evidence:* By code inspection, `submitProof()` is only called from `processReadyQueue()`, which only processes proofs with status READY.

*Claim 2:* A proof achieves status READY only when `pendingAncestors` is empty.

*Evidence:* The state transition WAITING → READY in `onAncestorConfirmed()` is guarded by:
```typescript
if (proof.pendingAncestors.size === 0) {
  proof.status = DeferralStatus.Ready;
}
```

*Claim 3:* `pendingAncestors` is initialized to all unfinalized ancestors and only decremented upon ancestor finalization.

*Evidence:* At proof enqueue:
```typescript
const pendingAncestors = new Set(
  options.ancestors.map(bytesToHex)
);
```

Removal occurs only in `onAncestorConfirmed()`:
```typescript
proof.pendingAncestors.delete(ancestorHex);
```

*Conclusion:* By Claims 1-3, submission occurs only when all ancestors have been finalized. Since finality events are triggered by on-chain finality, all ancestors have on-chain finality before any descendant proof is submitted. □

### B.2 Proof of Theorem 5.2 (Rollback Completeness)

**Theorem 5.2.** If task *u* fails, all descendants of *u* are eventually rolled back.

**Proof.** We prove that `rollbackCascade(u)` reaches all descendants.

*Claim 1:* `computeAffectedSet(u)` returns all descendants of *u*.

*Evidence:* The function performs BFS starting from *u*'s children:
```typescript
function computeAffectedSet(u):
  affected = {}
  queue = children(u)
  while queue not empty:
    v = queue.dequeue()
    if v not in affected:
      affected.add(v)
      queue.enqueue(children(v))
  return affected
```

By BFS completeness, all reachable nodes via child edges are visited. By definition, descendants are exactly the reachable nodes.

*Claim 2:* Every task in `affected` is rolled back.

*Evidence:* The algorithm iterates over all elements:
```typescript
for task in reverseTopologicalSort(affected):
  markRolledBack(task)
```

*Claim 3:* `validateNoOrphans(affected)` confirms completeness.

*Evidence:* Post-rollback validation:
```typescript
for task in affected:
  assert status(task) == ROLLED_BACK
  for child in children(task):
    assert child in affected OR status(child) == PENDING
```

Any missed descendant would fail this assertion.

*Conclusion:* By Claims 1-3, all descendants are identified and rolled back, with post-hoc validation confirming completeness. □
