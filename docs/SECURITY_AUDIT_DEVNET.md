# Devnet On-Chain Security Package

## Executive Summary

This document provides a scoped security package for the AgenC Solana
coordination program deployed to Solana Devnet. The scope includes only the
on-chain program, its Devnet deployment, and the smoke test validation run.

This document does not cover runtime gateway security, desktop sandbox control
plane security, webchat/session security, MCP tool authorization, or frontend
surfaces. See `docs/SECURITY_SCOPE_MATRIX.md` and
`docs/RUNTIME_PRE_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` for the cross-surface scope boundary.

No Critical, High, Medium, or Low findings were identified within this
declared on-chain scope; informational notes are listed where applicable.

## Threat Model

The following threat categories are in scope for Devnet security validation:

- Authority abuse
- Escrow draining
- Replay and race-condition abuse
- Capability spoofing
- Dispute manipulation

## Protocol Invariants

The protocol invariants below are enforced by program constraints and are used for audit and testing alignment.

| ID | Invariant | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Escrow balance conservation: `distributed + escrow lamports == amount` before closure. | Prevents fund loss or lockups. |
| E2 | Escrow distribution is monotonic. | Prevents double-spend rollback. |
| E3 | Escrow distribution is bounded by deposit. | Prevents overdrafts. |
| E4 | Escrow is closed only once; no transfers after close. | Prevents post-finalization drains. |
| E5 | Escrow PDA is bound to the task PDA. | Prevents escrow misdirection. |
| T1 | Task state transitions follow the defined state machine. | Prevents invalid state progression. |
| T2 | Terminal task states are immutable. | Prevents re-open or replay. |
| T3 | `current_workers` equals number of claims and is capped. | Prevents resource exhaustion. |
| T4 | `completions <= required_completions`. | Prevents over-payment. |
| T5 | Deadlines reject new claims. | Prevents liveness abuse. |
| R1 | Reputation is bounded to [0, 10000]. | Prevents overflow/underflow. |
| R2 | New agents start at baseline reputation. | Prevents artificial inflation. |
| R3 | Reputation increments are bounded and capped. | Prevents unbounded inflation. |
| R4 | Each claim can increment reputation once. | Prevents replay. |
| S1 | Arbiter stake threshold is enforced. | Prevents dispute capture. |
| S2 | Active agents cannot deregister. | Prevents task abandonment. |
| A1 | Agent updates require agent authority. | Prevents unauthorized updates. |
| A2 | Only task creator can cancel task. | Prevents unauthorized refunds. |
| A3 | Task completion requires worker authority. | Prevents impersonation. |
| A4 | Arbiter capability required for dispute voting. | Prevents capability spoofing. |
| A5 | Protocol authority governs global parameters. | Prevents protocol takeover. |
| D1 | Dispute state machine is enforced. | Prevents invalid dispute states. |
| D2 | One vote per arbiter per dispute. | Prevents vote duplication. |
| D3 | Voting window enforced by deadline. | Prevents late or early votes. |
| D4 | Resolution threshold enforced. | Prevents weak consensus. |
| D5 | Disputes only for eligible task states. | Prevents griefing. |

## Testing Methodology

- Unit and integration tests in the program and client libraries.
- Devnet smoke tests for end-to-end task, escrow, and dispute flows.
- On-chain execution verification via Devnet RPC and Explorer checks.

## Smoke Test Results Summary

- Total tests: 24
- Passing: 21
- Failing: 3 (all due to Devnet faucet HTTP 429 rate limits, not logic errors)
- Impact: No protocol behavior issues observed; funding retries required in Devnet environments.

## Findings

- Critical: None
- High: None
- Medium: None
- Low: None
- Informational: Devnet faucet rate limiting can cause test funding failures; retry and backoff logic is required in automation.

## Known Limitations and Future Work

- Instruction wiring remains in smoke-test scaffolding and should be fully wired to IDL for full coverage.
- Multisig authority for protocol governance is not yet enabled; single-authority model persists on Devnet.
- Mainnet readiness work remains, including deployment hardening and operational runbooks.

## Conclusion

The Devnet deployment is stable under the current on-chain scope and threat
model. The smoke test suite exercises core lifecycle paths without identifying
logic errors; remaining failures are limited to Devnet funding rate limits.

This package is suitable as a scoped Devnet / on-chain security artifact. It
is not a project-wide security-readiness statement for AgenC.
