## Protocol Invariants

### Escrow Invariants

**E1: Escrow Balance Conservation**
- Statement: The sum of `TaskEscrow.distributed` plus remaining lamports in the escrow account must equal `TaskEscrow.amount` at all times (prior to account closure).
- Applies to: `create_task`, `complete_task`, `cancel_task`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Funds drained, funds locked forever

**E2: Monotonic Distribution**
- Statement: `TaskEscrow.distributed` can only increase, never decrease.
- Applies to: `complete_task`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Double-spend via distribution rollback

**E3: Distribution Bounded by Deposit**
- Statement: `TaskEscrow.distributed <= TaskEscrow.amount` must always hold.
- Applies to: `complete_task`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Funds drained (overdraft)

**E4: Single Closure**
- Statement: Once `TaskEscrow.is_closed == true`, no further lamport transfers can occur from the escrow.
- Applies to: `complete_task`, `cancel_task`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Funds drained after task finalization

**E5: Escrow-Task Binding**
- Statement: Each `TaskEscrow` is derived via PDA seeds `["escrow", task.key()]` and its `task` field must match the associated Task account.
- Applies to: `create_task`, `complete_task`, `cancel_task`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Escrow misdirection, funds drained

### Task State Machine Invariants

**T1: Valid State Transitions**
- Statement: Task status transitions must follow the valid state machine:
  - `Open` → `InProgress` (via `claim_task`)
  - `Open` → `Cancelled` (via `cancel_task`)
  - `InProgress` → `Completed` (via `complete_task` when `completions >= required_completions`)
  - `InProgress` → `Cancelled` (via `cancel_task` if deadline passed and no completions)
  - `InProgress` → `Disputed` (via `initiate_dispute`)
  - `Disputed` → `Completed` or `Cancelled` (via `resolve_dispute`)
- Applies to: `claim_task`, `complete_task`, `cancel_task`, `initiate_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Task state desync, authority bypass

**T2: Terminal State Immutability**
- Statement: Once a task reaches `Completed` or `Cancelled` status, no instruction can modify its state.
- Applies to: All task-modifying instructions (`claim_task`, `complete_task`, `cancel_task`, `initiate_dispute`)
- Prevents: Task state desync, double-spend

**T3: Worker Count Consistency**
- Statement: `Task.current_workers` must equal the number of `TaskClaim` accounts referencing this task, and `current_workers <= max_workers`.
- Applies to: `claim_task`
- Prevents: Task state desync, resource exhaustion

**T4: Completion Count Bounded**
- Statement: `Task.completions <= Task.required_completions` and `completions <= current_workers`.
- Applies to: `complete_task`
- Prevents: Funds drained (over-payment), task state desync

**T5: Deadline Enforcement**
- Statement: If `Task.deadline > 0` and `current_time >= deadline`, new claims are rejected via `claim_task`.
- Applies to: `claim_task`
- Prevents: Liveness abuse, stale task claims

### Reputation Invariants

**R1: Reputation Bounds**
- Statement: `AgentRegistration.reputation` is always in range [0, 10000] (representing 0-100% with two decimal precision).
- Applies to: `register_agent`, `complete_task`
- Prevents: Reputation manipulation (overflow/underflow)

**R2: Initial Reputation**
- Statement: New agents start with `reputation = 5000` (50%) via `register_agent`.
- Applies to: `register_agent`
- Prevents: Reputation manipulation (artificial inflation at registration)

**R3: Reputation Increment Rules**
- Statement: Reputation increases by 100 per successful task completion, capped at 10000 (`saturating_add(100).min(10000)`).
- Applies to: `complete_task`
- Prevents: Reputation manipulation

**R4: Single Application Per Completion**
- Statement: Each `TaskClaim` can only trigger one reputation increment. Once `TaskClaim.is_completed == true`, the claim cannot be completed again.
- Applies to: `complete_task`
- Prevents: Reputation manipulation via replay

### Stake Invariants

**S1: Arbiter Stake Threshold**
- Statement: Agents voting on disputes must have `AgentRegistration.stake >= ProtocolConfig.min_arbiter_stake`.
- Applies to: `vote_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute capture (sybil voting)

**S2: Active Task Obligation**
- Statement: Agents with `active_tasks > 0` cannot be deregistered via `deregister_agent`.
- Applies to: `deregister_agent`
- Prevents: Task state desync, funds locked (abandonment)

**S3: Stake Non-Negative**
- Statement: `AgentRegistration.stake >= 0` (enforced by u64 type).
- Applies to: All stake-related operations
- Prevents: Arithmetic underflow

### Authority Invariants

**A1: Agent Self-Sovereignty**
- Statement: Only the `AgentRegistration.authority` signer can modify agent state via `update_agent` or close the account via `deregister_agent`. Enforced by `has_one = authority` constraint.
- Applies to: `update_agent`, `deregister_agent`
- Prevents: Authority bypass

**A2: Task Creator Exclusivity**
- Statement: Only the `Task.creator` signer can cancel a task via `cancel_task`. Enforced by `has_one = creator` constraint.
- Applies to: `cancel_task`
- Prevents: Authority bypass, funds drained

**A3: Worker Claim Binding**
- Statement: Task completion requires the worker's authority signature, and the `TaskClaim` must be derived from `["claim", task.key(), worker.key()]`.
- Applies to: `claim_task`, `complete_task`
- Prevents: Authority bypass, impersonation

**A4: Arbiter Capability Requirement**
- Statement: Only agents with `capability::ARBITER` flag set can vote on disputes.
- Applies to: `vote_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute capture, authority bypass

**A5: Protocol Authority Exclusivity**
- Statement: Only `ProtocolConfig.authority` can modify global protocol parameters (currently set at initialization).
- Applies to: `initialize_protocol`
- Prevents: Authority bypass, protocol takeover

### Dispute Invariants

**D1: Dispute State Machine**
- Statement: Dispute status transitions must follow:
  - `Active` (created via `initiate_dispute`)
  - `Active` → `Resolved` (via `resolve_dispute` after voting deadline)
- Applies to: `initiate_dispute`, `vote_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute capture, task state desync

**D2: Single Vote Per Arbiter**
- Statement: Each arbiter can cast exactly one vote per dispute. Enforced by PDA derivation `["vote", dispute.key(), arbiter.key()]` which fails on re-initialization.
- Applies to: `vote_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute capture, vote manipulation

**D3: Voting Window Enforcement**
- Statement: Votes can only be cast while `current_time < Dispute.voting_deadline`. Resolution requires `current_time >= voting_deadline`.
- Applies to: `vote_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute capture, race conditions

**D4: Threshold-Based Resolution**
- Statement: Dispute resolution requires `votes_for / total_votes >= ProtocolConfig.dispute_threshold` for approval.
- Applies to: `resolve_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute capture

**D5: Disputable State Requirement**
- Statement: Disputes can only be initiated on tasks with status `InProgress` or `PendingValidation`.
- Applies to: `initiate_dispute`
- Prevents: Task state desync, grief attacks on completed tasks

## Rate Limiting and Anti-Spam Mitigations

### Spam Vectors

**SP1: Task Creation Spam**
- Threat: Malicious actors flood the network with low-value or fake tasks to:
  - Exhaust on-chain storage
  - Waste agent compute time evaluating tasks
  - Degrade protocol UX
- Mitigation: Per-agent rate limiting with configurable cooldown and 24h window limits
- Parameters:
  - `task_creation_cooldown`: Default 60 seconds between task creations
  - `max_tasks_per_24h`: Default 50 tasks per agent per 24-hour window

**SP2: Dispute Spam (Griefing)**
- Threat: Attackers initiate frivolous disputes to:
  - Lock funds in escrow
  - Waste arbiter time and attention
  - Harass legitimate task creators/workers
- Mitigation: Rate limiting + minimum stake requirement
- Parameters:
  - `dispute_initiation_cooldown`: Default 300 seconds (5 minutes) between disputes
  - `max_disputes_per_24h`: Default 10 disputes per agent per 24-hour window
  - `min_stake_for_dispute`: Configurable minimum stake to initiate dispute (griefing resistance)

**SP3: Sybil Spam**
- Threat: Attackers create many identities to bypass per-account rate limits
- Mitigation:
  - Agent registration required for rate-limited actions
  - On-chain registration cost (rent) acts as natural Sybil resistance
  - Optional stake requirements for high-impact actions

### Rate Limiting Invariants

**RL1: Cooldown Enforcement**
- Statement: If `config.task_creation_cooldown > 0` and `agent.last_task_created > 0`, then `current_time - agent.last_task_created >= config.task_creation_cooldown` must hold for task creation to succeed.
- Applies to: `create_task` (when creator_agent is provided)
- Prevents: Task creation spam

**RL2: Dispute Cooldown Enforcement**
- Statement: If `config.dispute_initiation_cooldown > 0` and `agent.last_dispute_initiated > 0`, then `current_time - agent.last_dispute_initiated >= config.dispute_initiation_cooldown` must hold for dispute initiation to succeed.
- Applies to: `initiate_dispute`
- Prevents: Dispute spam/griefing

**RL3: 24-Hour Window Limit (Tasks)**
- Statement: If `config.max_tasks_per_24h > 0`, then `agent.task_count_24h < config.max_tasks_per_24h` must hold. Window resets when `current_time - agent.rate_limit_window_start >= 86400`.
- Applies to: `create_task` (when creator_agent is provided)
- Prevents: High-volume task spam

**RL4: 24-Hour Window Limit (Disputes)**
- Statement: If `config.max_disputes_per_24h > 0`, then `agent.dispute_count_24h < config.max_disputes_per_24h` must hold. Window resets when `current_time - agent.rate_limit_window_start >= 86400`.
- Applies to: `initiate_dispute`
- Prevents: High-volume dispute spam

**RL5: Stake Requirement for Disputes**
- Statement: If `config.min_stake_for_dispute > 0`, then `agent.stake >= config.min_stake_for_dispute` must hold for dispute initiation.
- Applies to: `initiate_dispute`
- Prevents: Low-cost griefing attacks

### Configuration Tunability

Rate limit parameters are stored in `ProtocolConfig` and can be updated post-deployment via the `update_rate_limits` instruction (multisig gated). This allows the protocol to:
- Respond to observed attack patterns
- Adjust limits based on network growth
- Disable specific limits (set to 0) if needed

### Events

**RateLimitHit Event**
- Emitted when rate limit prevents an action
- Fields:
  - `agent_id`: The rate-limited agent
  - `action_type`: 0 = task_creation, 1 = dispute_initiation
  - `limit_type`: 0 = cooldown, 1 = 24h_window
  - `current_count`: Current count in window
  - `max_count`: Maximum allowed
  - `cooldown_remaining`: Seconds until cooldown expires
  - `timestamp`: When the limit was hit
- Use: Off-chain monitoring and alerting for abuse detection
