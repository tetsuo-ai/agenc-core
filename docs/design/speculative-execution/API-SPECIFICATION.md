## 3. Events

### 3.1 Event Emitter Pattern

All components extend `EventEmitter` and emit typed events:

```typescript
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';

/**
 * Type-safe event emitter for speculation events.
 */
export interface TypedEventEmitter<Events extends Record<string, unknown>> {
  on<E extends keyof Events>(event: E, listener: (payload: Events[E]) => void): this;
  once<E extends keyof Events>(event: E, listener: (payload: Events[E]) => void): this;
  off<E extends keyof Events>(event: E, listener: (payload: Events[E]) => void): this;
  emit<E extends keyof Events>(event: E, payload: Events[E]): boolean;
}

/**
 * Map of event names to payload types.
 */
export interface SpeculationEvents {
  // Task events
  'task.added': TaskAddedPayload;
  'task.ready': TaskReadyPayload;
  'task.started': TaskStartedPayload;
  'task.completed': TaskCompletedPayload;
  'task.failed': TaskFailedPayload;
  
  // Commitment events
  'commitment.created': CommitmentCreatedPayload;
  'commitment.confirmed': CommitmentConfirmedPayload;
  'commitment.expired': CommitmentExpiredPayload;
  'commitment.invalidated': CommitmentInvalidatedPayload;
  
  // Proof events
  'proof.job.queued': ProofJobQueuedPayload;
  'proof.job.started': ProofJobStartedPayload;
  'proof.job.completed': ProofJobCompletedPayload;
  'proof.job.failed': ProofJobFailedPayload;
  'proof.job.deferred': ProofJobDeferredPayload;
  'proof.submitted': ProofSubmittedPayload;
  'proof.verified': ProofVerifiedPayload;
  
  // Rollback events
  'rollback.started': RollbackStartedPayload;
  'rollback.task.reverted': RollbackTaskRevertedPayload;
  'rollback.completed': RollbackCompletedPayload;
  'rollback.failed': RollbackFailedPayload;
  
  // Stake events
  'stake.bonded': StakeBondedPayload;
  'stake.released': StakeReleasedPayload;
  'stake.slashed': StakeSlashedPayload;
  
  // Decision events
  'speculation.decision': SpeculationDecisionPayload;
  
  // System events
  'system.depth.limit': DepthLimitReachedPayload;
  'system.resource.limit': ResourceLimitReachedPayload;
  'system.config.changed': ConfigChangedPayload;
  'system.paused': SystemPausedPayload;
  'system.resumed': SystemResumedPayload;
}
```

### 3.2 Event Handler Examples

```typescript

  console.warn(`Estimated ${payload.estimatedTaskCount} tasks affected`);
  
  // Alert if large rollback

      severity: 'warning',
      message: `Large rollback: ${payload.estimatedTaskCount} tasks`,
      metadata: payload,
    });
  }
});

// Stake slashing handler
scheduler.on('stake.slashed', (payload: StakeSlashedPayload) => {
  console.error(`Agent ${payload.agentId} slashed ${payload.slashedAmount} lamports`);
  
  // Record for analytics
  analytics.recordSlash({

      type: 'slash_compensation',
      amount: share,

  console.log(`Estimated wait: ${payload.estimatedWaitMs}ms`);
  
  metrics.deferredProofs.inc();
  metrics.deferralWaitTime.observe(payload.estimatedWaitMs);
});

// Configuration change handler
scheduler.on('system.config.changed', (payload: ConfigChangedPayload) => {
  console.log(`Configuration changed by ${payload.changedBy}`);
  
  for (const key of payload.changedKeys) {
    console.log(`  ${key}: ${payload.previousValues[key]} -> ${payload.newValues[key]}`);
  }
  
  // Audit log
  audit.log({
    action: 'config_change',
    changedBy: payload.changedBy,
    changes: payload.changedKeys,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  });
});

// Comprehensive event logger
function setupEventLogging(scheduler: SpeculativeTaskScheduler) {
  const events: (keyof SpeculationEvents)[] = [

## Appendix A: Usage Examples

### A.1 Basic Speculation Flow

```typescript
import {
  SpeculativeTaskScheduler,
  TaskNode,
  TaskStatus,
  SpeculationConfig,
} from '@tetsuo-ai/speculation';

// Create configuration
const config: SpeculationConfig = {
  enabled: true,
  mode: 'balanced',
  core: {
    maxDepth: 5,
    maxParallelBranches: 4,
    confirmationTimeoutMs: 30000,
    claimBufferMs: 60000,
    minConfidenceScore: 70,
    allowCrossAgentSpeculation: false,
  },
  stake: {
    minStake: 1000000n,
    maxStake: 1000000000n,
    baseBond: 100000n,
    depthMultiplier: 2.0,
    slashPercentage: 0.1,
    protocolSlashShare: 0.5,
    cooldownPeriodMs: 60000,
  },
  // ... rest of config
};

// Initialize scheduler
const scheduler = new SpeculativeTaskScheduler(config);
await scheduler.start();

// Create root task
const rootTask: TaskNode = {
  id: 'task-root',
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  dependsOn: null,
  status: TaskStatus.PENDING,
  claimExpiry: Date.now() + 300000,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  estimatedComputeMs: 5000,
  speculationDepth: 0,
  inputHash: '0x1234...',
  metadata: {
    priority: 1,
    retryCount: 0,
    maxRetries: 3,
    labels: {},
  },
};

// Schedule root task
const rootDecision = await scheduler.scheduleTask(rootTask);
console.log('Root task scheduled, speculating:', rootDecision.shouldSpeculate);

// Create child task that depends on root
const childTask: TaskNode = {
  id: 'task-child',
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  dependsOn: 'task-root',
  status: TaskStatus.PENDING,
  claimExpiry: Date.now() + 300000,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  estimatedComputeMs: 3000,
  speculationDepth: 1, // Will be calculated
  inputHash: '0x5678...',
  metadata: {
    priority: 1,
    retryCount: 0,
    maxRetries: 3,
    labels: {},
  },
};

// Schedule child task (may speculate on root)
const childDecision = await scheduler.scheduleTask(childTask, 'task-root');
console.log('Child task decision:', {
  speculate: childDecision.shouldSpeculate,
  depth: childDecision.depth,
  stake: childDecision.requiredStake,
  reasons: childDecision.reasons,
});

// Report root task completion
await scheduler.reportCompletion('task-root', {
  outputHash: '0xabcd...',
  executionTrace: new Uint8Array([...]),
  computeTimeMs: 4500,
});

// Report on-chain confirmation
await scheduler.reportConfirmation(
  'task-root',
  'tx-signature-123',
  12345678
);

// Graceful shutdown
await scheduler.stop(30000);
```

### A.2 Handling Rollbacks

```typescript
// Set up rollback event handlers
scheduler.on('rollback.started', (payload) => {
  console.warn('Rollback started:', {
    trigger: payload.triggerCommitmentId,
    reason: payload.reason,
    estimatedTasks: payload.estimatedTaskCount,
  });
  
  // Notify monitoring
  alerting.warn('Speculation rollback initiated', payload);
});

scheduler.on('rollback.task.reverted', (payload) => {
  console.log('Task reverted:', {
    taskId: payload.task.taskId,
    depth: payload.task.speculationDepth,
    wastedCompute: payload.task.wastedComputeMs,
  });
});

scheduler.on('rollback.completed', (payload) => {
  const result = payload.result;
  console.log('Rollback completed:', {
    duration: result.durationMs,
    tasksRolledBack: result.rolledBackTasks.length,
    stakeReleased: result.totalReleasedStake,
    stakeSlashed: result.totalSlashedStake,
  });
  
  // Record metrics
  metrics.rollbackDuration.observe(result.durationMs);
  metrics.tasksRolledBack.inc(result.rolledBackTasks.length);
});

// Manually trigger rollback for testing/emergency
const simulation = await scheduler.rollbackController.simulateRollback(
  'commitment-to-fail'
);
console.log('Rollback simulation:', {
  affectedTasks: simulation.affectedTasks.length,
  stakeAtRisk: simulation.totalStakeAtRisk,
  computeAtRisk: simulation.totalComputeAtRisk,
});

if (simulation.affectedTasks.length < 10) {
  // Safe to proceed
  const result = await scheduler.rollbackController.rollback(
    'commitment-to-fail',
    RollbackReason.MANUAL_REQUEST
  );
}
```

### A.3 Monitoring and Observability

```typescript
// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const health = scheduler.healthCheck();
  
  res.status(health.healthy ? 200 : 503).json({
    status: health.healthy ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
    components: health.components,
    issues: health.issues,
    lastCheck: new Date(health.lastCheck).toISOString(),
  });
});

// Metrics endpoint
app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
  const stats = scheduler.getStats();
  
  // Prometheus format
  const lines = [
    `# HELP speculation_tasks_scheduled Total tasks scheduled`,
    `# TYPE speculation_tasks_scheduled counter`,
    `speculation_tasks_scheduled ${stats.tasksScheduled}`,
    
    `# HELP speculation_active_commitments Current active commitments`,
    `# TYPE speculation_active_commitments gauge`,
    `speculation_active_commitments ${stats.ledger.activeCommitments}`,
    
    `# HELP speculation_avg_depth Average speculation depth`,
    `# TYPE speculation_avg_depth gauge`,
    `speculation_avg_depth ${stats.avgSpeculationDepth}`,
    
    // ... more metrics
  ];
  
  res.set('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.send(lines.join('\n'));
});

// Periodic stats logging
setInterval(() => {
  const stats = scheduler.getStats();
  
  logger.info('Speculation stats', {
    uptime: stats.uptime,
    throughput: stats.throughputTasksPerSecond,
    latencyReduction: `${(stats.latencyReduction * 100).toFixed(1)}%`,
    avgDepth: stats.avgSpeculationDepth.toFixed(2),
    activeCommitments: stats.ledger.activeCommitments,
    queueDepth: stats.proofs.currentQueueDepth,
    rollbacks: stats.rollbacks,
  });
}, 60000);
```

## Appendix B: Migration Guide

### B.1 From Synchronous to Speculative Execution

```typescript
// Before: Synchronous execution
async function executeTaskSync(task: Task): Promise<Result> {
  // Wait for parent to complete
  if (task.dependsOn) {
    await waitForConfirmation(task.dependsOn);
  }
  
  // Execute
  const result = await execute(task);
  
  // Generate and submit proof
  const proof = await generateProof(result);
  await submitProof(proof);
  
  return result;
}

// After: Speculative execution
async function executeTaskSpeculative(task: TaskNode): Promise<void> {
  // Schedule through speculation system
  const decision = await scheduler.scheduleTask(task, task.dependsOn);
  
  if (decision.shouldSpeculate) {
    logger.info(`Speculating on ${task.id} at depth ${decision.depth}`);
    
    // Execute immediately (speculative)
    const result = await execute(task);
    
    // Report completion (proof will be deferred if needed)
    await scheduler.reportCompletion(task.id, {
      outputHash: result.hash,
      executionTrace: result.trace,
      computeTimeMs: result.duration,
    });
    
    // Handle potential rollback
    scheduler.once('rollback.task.reverted', (payload) => {
      if (payload.task.taskId === task.id) {
        logger.warn(`Task ${task.id} was rolled back`);
        // Handle rollback (e.g., revert side effects)
      }
    });
  } else {
    logger.info(`Not speculating on ${task.id}:`, decision.reasons);
    // Fall back to synchronous execution
    await executeTaskSync(task);
  }
}
```
