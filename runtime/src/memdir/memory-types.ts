 *
 * Why this lives here / shape difference from upstream:
 *   - PR-08 owns the extraction-prompt taxonomy surface declared for
 *     `runtime/src/memdir/memory-types.ts`.
 *   - AgenC's extraction child currently writes to one project memory root, so
 *     this file carries the individual-mode taxonomy used by that prompt.
 *
 * Scope boundaries:
 *   - global/project/team recall prompt sections owned by runtime/src/memory.

Great user memories help you tailor your future behavior to the user's preferences and perspective. Your goal in reading and writing these memories is to build up an understanding of who the user is and how you can be most helpful to them specifically. For example, you should collaborate with a senior software engineer differently than a student who is coding for the very first time. Keep in mind, that the aim here is to be helpful to the user. Avoid writing memories about the user that could be viewed as a negative judgement or that are not relevant to the work you're trying to accomplish together.</description>",
